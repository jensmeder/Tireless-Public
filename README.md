# Tireless-Public

Tireless connects to Bluetooth tire pressure sensors on refresh Model 3/Y and provides insights into the state of your wheels.

- Low battery? Tireless will tell you when to replace the sensor in your wheel.

- Your car has problems connecting to one of the pressure sensors? Tireless can verify if your sensor is working correctly before scheduling a service appointment.

- Buying used wheels from a third party? Tireless will verify if the built-in tire pressure sensors can talk to your car.

- Have you ever wondered how hot your tires get during a ride? Tireless will tell you.
